        <h3>About me</h3>
    
        <p><span>I am an undergraduate student at the <strong>University of Brighton</strong> getting degree in 
        <strong>BSc(Hons) Computer Science for Games</strong> who wants to become a <strong>Game Developer</strong>. 
        </span></p><p><span>I have played video games since I was a child and had always found them interesting. 
        It was the best escape from real world for me and I knew that I can come back to them anytime I want.</span>
        </p><p><span>After discovering programming in college I have decided that I want to dedicate my life to game 
        programming. </span></p><p><span>I like to code, but I am also interested in other parts of game development, 
        so occasionally I venture to different parts such as <strong>Sound</strong>, <strong>3D modelling</strong> 
        and <strong>Animation</strong>.</span></p>
